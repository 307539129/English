\title{Instance-aware Semantic Segmentation Via Multi-task Network Cascades}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
  Semantic segmentation research has recently witnessed rapid progress, but many leading methods are unable to identify object instances.
\end{abstract}
\section{Introduction}
Since the development of fully convolutional networks, the accuracy of semantic segmentation has been improved rapidly thanks to deeply learned features, large-scale annotations , and advanced reasoning over graphical models. Nevertheless, FCNs and improvements are designed to predict a category label for each pixel, but are unaware of individual object instances\cite{Briggs2013Instance}. \\

\section{Related Work}
Object detection methods involve predicting object bounding boxes and categories\cite{Jankovic2015Context}.In SPPnet and Fast RCNN, the convolutional layers of CNNs are shared on the entire image for fast computation. Faster R-CNN exploits the shared convolutional features to extract region proposals used by the detector. Sharing convolutional features leads to substantially faster speed for object detection systems\cite{Miledi2016How}.\\

\section{Multi-task Network Cascades}
In MNC model, the network takes an image of arbitrary size as the input, and outputs instance-aware semantic segmentation results.The cascade has three stages: propos ing box-level instances, regressing mask-level instances, and categorizing each instance.These three stages are designed to share convolutional features. Each stage involves a loss term, but a later stage¡¯s loss relies on the output of an earlier stage, so the three loss terms are not independent\cite{Zhou2014In}.

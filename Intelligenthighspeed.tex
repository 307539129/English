\section{text}
The Fuxing trains are a substantial upgrade on the previous Hexie (Harmony) bullet trains. Entirely designed and manufactured in China, the Fuxing train is more spacious and energy-efficient, with longer service life and better reliability.
\par
With the development of science and technology, the speed of trains has gradually increased. The promotion of train speed not only takes people to travel, but also provides convenient transportation for the development of cities. The more developed cities are, the more conducive to attracting talents and investment. Train is a low cost and fast transportation tool. Trains can run long distances. It is a good choice for long-distance travelers. With the development of technology, the speed of trains will be faster and more comfortable, and future trains may become the main means of transportation for people to travel.\\

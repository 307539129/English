\section{text}
Hackers successfully invaded the central command of the United States to remind people that network security issues can not be ignored. President Obama suggested that the data intrusion method should be used to urge enterprises , to report incidents of network intrusion and personal information loss. At the same time, it is suggested that enterprises and governments should strengthen exchanges.
\par
The proposal is good, but people will worry that the government's regulatory information may encroachment on privacy. The establishment of data security law, to a certain extent, can protect information security of enterprises or individuals.
\par
This is not a bad thing, if information flows into institutions that protect key infrastructure in the United States.

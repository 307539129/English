China will become the world's largest production base for display screens as early as 2019 as money flows into assembly lines, industrial associations have said. The associations expect the country will overtake the Republic of Korea (ROK) to have the largest production capacity globally.

\section{text}
China's display manufacturing has gained steam, with booming production and rising corporate profits. Domestic brands have also broken the dominance of imported high-end OLED panels.\cite{higham1994bibtex}
\par
With the development of China's economy and technology, China's panel production has been developing vigorously. Now more and more people have approved our flat products. With abundant resources and abundant labor force, China can produce more products and export more. The increase in product prices, the increase in the rate of good products and the increase in the proportion of high-end display also brought about a substantial improvement in business performance.

\section{background}
Researchers at the University of Texas discovered that people are worse at conducting tasks and remembering information if they have a smartphone within eye shot. In two experiments they found phones sitting on a desk or even in a pocket or handbag would distract users and lead to worse test scores even when it was set up not to disturb test subjects.

\section{text}
Researchers believe that the reason why mobile phones have an impact on cognitive ability is that when the phone is in the range of sight, the user needs to consume part of its attention to warn themselves not to be distracted and to prevent problems such as text messages.\cite{higham1994bibtex}

Nowadays, people are addicted to mobile phones. When they are at parties, they will keep playing with mobile phones. For a long time, they will become dependent on mobile phones. Playing with mobile phones for a long time slows people's reaction.

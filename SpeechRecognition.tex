\title{Fast and Accurate Recurrent Neural Network Acoustic Models for Speech Recognition}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
  We have recently shown that deep Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) outperform feed forward deep neural networks (DNNs) as acoustic models for speech recognition.
\end{abstract}
\section{Introduction}
While speech recognition systems using recurrent and feedforward neural networks have been around for more than two decades\cite{Barat2016String}, it is only recently that they have displaced Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) as the state-of-the-art acoustic model\cite{Eiber2013Attaining}. More recently, it has been shown that recurrent neural networks can outperform feed-forward networks on large-scale speech recognition tasks\cite{Krogh1995Neural}. \\

\section{RNN Acoustic Modeling Techniques}
In this work we focus on the LSTM RNN architecture which has shown good performance in our previous research, outperforming deep neural networks.\cite{Pustejovsky1998The}.\\

are generated every 10ms, but are concatenated and downsampled
for input to the network: 8 frames are stacked for unidirectional
(top) and 3 for bidirectional models (bottom).

\section{Experiments}
We train and evaluate LSTM RNN acoustic models on handtranscribed, anonymized utterances taken from real 16kHz Google voice search traffic\cite{Sanger1989Optimal}. Our training set consists of 3 million utterances with average duration of about 4s\cite{Szu1992Neural}. To achieve robustness to background noise and reverberant environments we synthetically distort each utterance in a room simulator with a virtual noise source\cite{Wittrock1989Generative}.

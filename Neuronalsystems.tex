\begin{abstract}
   The development of stochastic resonance took a large leap forward when its potential relevance for neurophysiological processes had been recognized. Longtin, Bulsara, and Moss  observed that interspike interval histograms of periodically stimulated neurons exhibit a remarkable resemblance to residence-time distributions of periodically driven bistable systems.
\end{abstract}
\section{Introduction}
In this section, we report on the relevant neurophysiological experiments and describe how stochastic resonance enters naturally into standard models for neuronal dynamics. By now, stochastic resonance is a well accepted paradigm in the biological and neurophysiological sciences, and several recent reviews on neurophysiological applications of stochastic resonance are available\cite{Benzi1983A}.

\section{Neurophysiological background}
There is a large variety of types of neurons in the nervous system of animals and humans with variations in structure, function, and size. Let us restrict ourselves here to a canonical neuron, which presents the underlying functional skeleton for all neurons. The canonical neuron is divided into three parts, an input part, a processing part, and a signal transmission part\cite{Gammaitoni1995Stochastic}. \\

\section{Neuron firing and Poissonian spike trains}
Wiesenfeld, Pierson, Pantazelou, Dames, and Moss proposed a very elegant approximate theory for modeling neuron firing in the presence of noise and a periodic stimulus. The neuron emits uncorrelated, sharp spikes at random times t n . The spiking rate, however, is inhomogeneous, i.e., sinusoidally modulated. This sort of process is described by the theory of inhomogeneous Poissonian point processes¡ªsee\cite{Hu1990Periodically}.

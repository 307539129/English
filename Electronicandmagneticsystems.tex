\section{introduction}
  Stochastic resonance was realized in an electronic circuit,a simple Schmitt trigger (Fauve and Heslot, 1983). Since then, stochastic resonance has been observed in a variety of more or less complicated electronic devices, mostly constructed with the purpose of building flexible and inexpensive simulation tools.

\section{Analog electronic simulators}
As mentioned in Sec. II.C, electronic circuits have been widely employed in the study of nonlinear stochastic equations.\cite{Alpher02} The realization of an electronic simulation circuit requires the design of specific electronic devices which operate as the single components of the block scheme depicted in Fig. 23.
\begin{equation}
\quad x'=x-x^3+u(t)+A_0 cos(st)
\end{equation}
\section{Electron paramagnetic resonance}
An EPR system consists of a paramagnetic sample placed in a microwave cavity. A microwave generator irradiates the sample while a feedback electronic circuit locks the oscillator frequency to the resonant frequency Nc of the cavity.\cite{Alpher04}\\


\section{Superconducting quantum interference devices}
The basic components of a SQUID are a superconducting loop and a Josephson junction. For practical purposes, a SQUID can be envisioned as an electromagnetic device that converts a magnetic flux variation into a voltage variation and, as such, it has been successfully employed in monitoring small magnetic field fluctuations.\cite{Alpher03}\\
